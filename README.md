# Cinema Tickets (JavaScript)
This is my submission for the cinema tickets coding exercise.

To see the code working install the dependencies and run the tests from the root directory with the command:
```
npm i && npm t
```

You will need **node version 16.15.1 or higher** installed.

<br />

# Design overview
Interfaces which were already provided (e.g. the parameters for the ticket service's `purchaseTickets` public method) have been left them as they were.

<br />

## Infant seat allocation assumption
From the task README:
> "Infants... are not allocated a seat. They will be sitting on an Adult's lap."

Has been interpreted literally as any number of infants can sit on an adult's lap.  If we wanted to enforce a maximum number of infants per adult, a `maxInfantsPerAdult` property could be added to the `TicketService` class along with an additional check in the `#validatePurchaseRequest` method.



<br />

## TicketService class
- Is passed **instances** of the payment/seat reservation classes in the constructor
- Has an optional policy parameter in the constructor to set the maximum tickets that can be purchased, ticket types, prices, and seats allocated.  If it is left empty, the default policy is used (all the values given in the task README).
- Has one public method, `purchaseTickets` which (if the purchase request is successful) returns a response object:
<br/><pre><code>{
    text: "You have purchased 2 tickets for a total of Â£30 and reserved 2 seats",
    tickets: 2,
    price: 30,
    seats: 2
    }</code></pre>

- Has several private methods which are used to validate ticket system instantiation and ticket purchase requests, calculate price/seat allocation/number of tickets, and make payments/seat reservations.
- Throws exceptions if the class is incorrectly instantiated or if the purchase request is invalid (see **Future improvements** below for comments on this).

<br />

## TicketTypeRequest class
- The second check in the constructor is now more strict and only allows positive integers for `noOfTickets`.
- Instances are now immutable.

<br />

## Exceptions
- Added `InvalidTicketSystemSetupException` and made both custom exceptions extensions of the `Error` class.

<br />

## Testing
`Jest` is used for testing along with additional matchers provided by `jest-extended`.  Tests have been split for:
- `TicketService` class
- `TicketTypeRequest` class
- Custom exceptions `InvalidTicketServiceSetupException` and `InvalidPurchaseException`


<br />

# Future improvements
- Failed purchase attempts using the `purchaseTickets` method simply throw an exception.  It might be better to have the method catch those exceptions and return a response object.  The response object could have a `success` property which is set to `true` or `false` depending on the outcome, and the `text` property could be set to the exception's error message if the purchase failed.
- The way ticket requests are validated and then the values for tickets/prices/seatsd are calculated is computationally inefficient (using many loops).  This could be improved by using fewer loops containing more logic in each, although this would reduce the separation of concerns and potentiatlly make the code more difficult to read.
- We could extract all of the business requirements (not just maximum tickets, ticket types, prices, and seats allocated) into the policy object instead of having them written in the `#validatePurchaseRequest` method itself.  This would allow for more flexibility in the future if the requirements were to change (especially if we want to use subclasses to implement policies differently).
- It might be beneficial to have a single source of truth for allowed ticket types.  Currently if a new ticket type was added to the TicketTypeRequest class but not to the policy object and a ticket purchase request was made with that ticket type, the `#validatePurchaseRequest` method would not throw an exception, but a TypeError would occur when the `#calculateTotalCostInPounds` method tried to access the price of the new ticket type.  Alternatively we could have an additional check in the `#validatePurchaseRequest` method to ensure that the ticket type is allowed by the ticket system.
- Static type checking (e.g. TypeScript) to ensure correct types are passed in and returned, and reduce the number of validation checks/tests which are currently made.
- If prices which are not full pounds are to be used in the future this could be accounted for by dealing with prices in pennies (up until values in pounds are needed) or alter how certain error checks are being handled.
- Complete JSDoc documentation.
